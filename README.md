# Java-Core-Basic-Level

Homework One.

1. Create an empty project in IntelliJ IDEA and write the main method().
2. Create variables of all passed data types, and initialize their values.
3. Write a method that evaluates the expression a * (b + (c / d)) and returns the result, where a, b, c, d are the input parameters of this method.
4. Write a method that accepts two numbers as input and checks that their sum is between 10 and 20 (inclusive). if Yes, return true, otherwise false.
5. Write a method to which an integer is passed as a parameter, the method must print to the console whether the number is positive or negative; Note: zero is considered a positive number.
6. Write a method that passes an integer as a parameter. the method should return true if the number is negative.
7. Write a method to which a string indicating the name is passed as a parameter. the method should output the message "Hello, specified name!».
8. * Write a method that determines whether the year is a leap year and outputs a message to the console. Every 4th year is a leap year, except for every 100th, and every 400th is a leap year.


Homework Two.

1. Set an integer array consisting of elements 0 and 1. For example: [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0 ]. Use the loop and condition to replace 0 with 1, 1 with 0;
2. Set an empty integer array of size 8. Use the loop to fill it with the values 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21;
3. Set an array [ 1, 5, 3, 2, 11, 4, 5, 2, 4, 8, 9, 1 ] go through it in a loop, and multiply numbers smaller than 6 by 2;
4. Create a square two-dimensional integer array (the number of rows and columns is the same), and use the loop (s) to fill its diagonal elements with units;
5. ** Set a one-dimensional array and find the minimum and maximum elements in it (without the help of the Internet);
6. ** Write a method that passes a non-empty one-dimensional integer array, the method must return true if there is a place in the array where the sum of the left and right parts of the array are equal. Examples: checkBalance([2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, || 10, 1]) → true, checkBalance([1, 1, 1, || 2, 1]) → true, the border is shown with | | characters, these characters are not included in the array.
7. **** Write a method that uses a one-dimensional array and the number n (it can be positive or negative) as input, and the method must shift all the elements of the array by n positions. You can't use auxiliary arrays to complicate the task.
